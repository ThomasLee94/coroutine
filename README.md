## Concurrency

Concurrency describes things that are waiting to occur  at *the same time*. This means that in a concurrent program, several executions are not happening simultaneously as different "streams" but rather context switching and most likely overlapping with other streams. 

These streams also have the ability to communicate and interupt other concurrent streams. This is to say that concurrent programs are able to handle mutliple different tasks at once. 

Concurrency is a single threaded process.

## Parallelism

Parallelism describes seperate streams being executed simultaneously. Only possible on a 2+ cpu (multiple threads)

Concurrency is dealing with multiple things at once, parallelism is doing multiple things at once.
