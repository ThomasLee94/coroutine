## Concurrency

Concurrency describes things that are occuring at *the same time*. This means that in a concurrent program, several executions may be happening simultaneously in different "streams".

These streams also have the ability to communicate and interupt other concurrent streams. This is to say that concurrent programs are able to handle mutliple different tasks at once.
It is important to note that a task being executed by a stream

Concurrency is dealing with multiple things at once, parallelism is doing multiple things at once.
